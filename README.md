# FaceMaskDectection

Developed an advanced machine learning model capable of accurately discerning whether an individual in a given image is wearing a mask or not. Leveraging state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) along with Sklearn, Numpy, and Pandas, I have crafted a sophisticated solution for real-time mask detection. The model seamlessly assigns values, with 1 representing the absence of a mask and 0 indicating its presence, contributing to public health and safety efforts.
